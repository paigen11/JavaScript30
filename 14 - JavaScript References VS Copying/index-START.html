    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

//    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // if you update the variable referring to another variable (i.e. update team which refers back to players), it updates the original variable players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    team2[3] = 'Lux'; // this only affects team2, not the original players array
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Woo hoo!';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Cool';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Paige',
        age: 28
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
//    const captain = person;
//    captain.age = 99;
//    console.log(captain); // this overwrites the person's age with the new captain age because it's referencing the original object

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { luckyNumber: 11, age: 99, hobbies: 'sailing'});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const paige = {
        name: 'Paige',
        age: '30',
        husband: {
            firstName: 'Sean',
            lastName: 'Laughlin'
        }
    };

    console.log(paige);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, paige);
    console.log(dev);

    dev.husband.firstName = 'Sean Robert'

    console.log(paige, dev); // shoot - the husband.firstName is updated for both because Object.assign only makes copies one level deep, not more

    // if you must clone you can do this - it's the poor man's deep clone
    dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(paige));
    dev2.husband.firstName = 'Sean Robert Nelson';
    console.log(paige, dev2);
